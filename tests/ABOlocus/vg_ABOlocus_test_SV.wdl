# This example uses vg_construct_and_index.wdl to build a graph including the
# ABO locus from GRCh38 (a 50Kbp region including the gene), and a known 5.8kbp
# deletion segregating in human populations. It then maps 1000 Genomes Project
# reads from a carrier of this deletion, verifying that vg maps some reads
# along the deletion edge.

#   deletions called by the 1000 Genomes Project. Vox Sang 113(2):185-197
